# NewBird

Our program endeavors to integrate with eBird’s database to give users a streamlined and user-friendly way to catalog their bird sightings without having to deal with the complicated minutia of eBird’s science-focused site. The program integrates multiple APIs in order to fetch data related to birds and display it to the users.
